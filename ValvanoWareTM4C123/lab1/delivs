A) Objectives 

Re-familiarize ourselves with the launchpad and relevant concepts like;
  - hw/sw fifos
  - uart communication / serial i/o
  - LCD drivers
  - sw/hw interrupts
  
B) Hardware Design (not assigned for lab 1)
  
C) Software Design

D) Measurement Data

1) 475 ns

2) 1.320 us

E) Analysis and Discussion

1) range: 0 to 3.3 V
   resolution: 4096
   precision: 0.8 mV
   
2) Software-triggered interrupts (start the interrupt in the user program),
or timer-triggered (use systick or another system timer)

3) We used the first method; we toggled an LED on-off-on, and measure the time between off-on.
  The second method is somewhat more accurate since it includes the push and pop before and after the ISR.
  
4) 47.5 ns

5) assuming 80 Mhz clock freq.
  range: 0 to 209.715 ms
  resolution: 2 ^ 24
  precision: 12.5 ns (clock period)
