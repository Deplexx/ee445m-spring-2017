1)	Briefly explain the dynamic memory allocation algorithm in your heap manager. Does this implementation have internal or external fragmentation?

We used the given heap implementation. There is some slight internal fragmentation because of alignment. External fragmentation is a problem, but it mitigated by merging contiguous free blocks.

2)	How many simultaneously active processes can your system support? What factors limit this number, and how could it be increased?

20; We are limited by the maximum number of threads our system can handle, and by the pcb list's static allocation.
